# Election_Analysis
## Overview of Project
This project was created in order to provide the election results from multiple counties in regards three different candidates for Congressional Election. While we will be able to see who the winning candidate was, we will also be able to see the following data:

    a) Total Votes
    b) Votes per County
    c) Largest County turnout
    d) Votes and its percentage per Candidate
    
## Analysis of the Election
The contenders this year were Diana DeGette, Charles Casper Stockham and Raymon Anthony Doane. This election involved three different locations: Arapahoe County, Denver County and Jefferson County. The total number of registered votes for the election was 369,711 and below we will see how the data was allocated for each County and each candidate.

### Vote Breakdown per County:

As you can see on the information above, Denver County had the biggest turnout with a remarkable 306,055 of the total votes. Without any other information available, we can only assume that the candidate's focus during the election shoul've been Denver County. Votes from Arapahoe and Jefferson counties showed a very low turn out representing slightly above 17% or 63,656 of the total votes.

### Vote Breakdown per Candidate:

It is clear that Diana DeGette was the candidate with the most appreciation from the voters as she alone obtained 272,892 or 73.8% of the total votes. Both, Stockham and Doane had literaly no chance on winning this election.

## Items to consider for the next election process
### 1. Registered Voters
It is important to know how many voters are registered per county in order to understand how many people missed submitting their vote for the election. Once that number is known, we then need to identify what can be done to minimize the possibility of an individual not voting.
### 2. Methods available for submitting votes
We have to identify what are the methods avaiable out there when submitting a vote. Knowing what method was the most successful when voting could help us understand trends and perhaps the needs of each county for an honest and fair election.
